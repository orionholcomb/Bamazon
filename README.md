# Bamazon

Welcome to Bamazon, created by Orion Holcomb!

To start the application, go in your terminal and run the bamazonCustomer.js application with node. It should look something like this:

"node bamazonCustomer.js"

It's that easy! Afterwards, you will be prompted to identify the item you'd like to purchase and how much.

Enjoy!

{NOTE: This application only contains the customer application, and does not have a manager or supervisor applications as of right now.}
